From the About section of [nesbot/carbon](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon) package on GitHub:

- A simple PHP API extension for DateTime.

It is an extension of  PHP's native `DateTime` object. It adds lots of cool stuff onto `DateTime`and makes it easier to do date and time manipulations.

Let's see how Laravel uses this package to provide even more simpler abstraction such as:

```php
$now = now(); // returns current date and time as Carbon instance
```

## Code Dive

Let's start from definition of `now()` method. It can be found in `Illuminate\Foundation\helpers.php` file.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Date;

/**
 * Create a new Carbon instance for the current time.
 *
 * @param  \DateTimeZone|string|null  $tz
 * @return \Illuminate\Support\Carbon
 */
function now($tz = null)
{
    return Date::now($tz);
}
```

We can see that its calling `now()` method on `Date` facade. 

### Date facade

```php
namespace Illuminate\Support\Facades;

use Illuminate\Support\DateFactory;

class Date extends Facade
{
    const DEFAULT_FACADE = DateFactory::class;

    /**
     * Get the registered name of the component.
     *
     * @return string
     *
     * @throws \RuntimeException
     */
    protected static function getFacadeAccessor()
    {
        return 'date';
    }

    /**
     * Resolve the facade root instance from the container.
     *
     * @param  string  $name
     * @return mixed
     */
    protected static function resolveFacadeInstance($name)
    {
        if (! isset(static::$resolvedInstance[$name]) && 
			! isset(static::$app, static::$app[$name])) {

            $class = static::DEFAULT_FACADE;

            static::swap(new $class);
        }

        return parent::resolveFacadeInstance($name);
    }
}
```

We have a typical `getFacadeAccessor` method that returns a string (`date`). But there are few other things that we haven't seen before. `const DEFAULT_FACADE` and `resolveFacadeInstance` method.

Since this is not a module like `Log` or `Scheduling` etc, there is no separate **ServiceProvider** for this to perform service container binding. Therefore inside `resolveFacadeInstance` method it is swapping the underlying instance behind `Date` facade to `DateFactory` class.

We can also confirm this by using `app()` helper like below:

```php
app('date'); // returns instance of `Illuminate\Support\DateFactory` class 
```

### DateFactroy class

Below is a ripped off version of `DateFactory` class which helps us understand implementation detail behind `now()` helper method. This class has other stuff too, see full implementation [here](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/8.x/src/Illuminate/Support/DateFactory.php).

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Carbon;

class DateFactory
{
    /**
     * The default class that will be used for all created dates.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    const DEFAULT_CLASS_NAME = Carbon::class;

    /**
     * The type (class) of dates that should be created.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected static $dateClass;

    /**
     * Handle dynamic calls to generate dates.
     *
     * @param  string  $method
     * @param  array  $parameters
     * @return mixed
     *
     * @throws \RuntimeException
     */
    public function __call($method, $parameters)
    {
        $defaultClassName = static::DEFAULT_CLASS_NAME;

        $dateClass = static::$dateClass ?: $defaultClassName;

        // Check if date can be created using public class method...
        if (
            method_exists($dateClass, $method) ||
            $dateClass::hasMacro($method)
        ) {
            return $dateClass::$method(...$parameters);
        }
    }
}
```

Since `now()` method does not exist on this class and we are also in `object` context from `Date` facade, therefore, `__call()` magic method will be triggered when we do `Date::now()`. 

Inside `__call()` method we can see that `$dateClass` is being set to `Illuminate\Support\Carbon` class. After that it checks if given method ( `now()` ) exists on that class or this method is a **macro.** Once decided, it calls that **method** on `Illuminate\Support\Carbon` class.

### Illuminate\Support\Carbon

```php
<?php

namespace Illuminate\Support;

use Carbon\Carbon as BaseCarbon;
use Carbon\CarbonImmutable as BaseCarbonImmutable;

class Carbon extends BaseCarbon
{
}
```

Here we can see that this class extends `Carbon\Carbon` class from `nesbot/carbon` package. It can be considered as wrapper class around `Carbon\Carbon` which allows you to do interesting stuff like adding **Macros.** 

### Finding now() method

With above findings we can safely assume that `now()` method should be on `Carbon\Carbon` class. But exactly where? Let's find out.

```php
use Carbon\Traits\Date;

class Carbon extends DateTime implements CarbonInterface
{
    use Date;

    /**
     * Returns true if the current class/instance is mutable.
     *
     * @return bool
     */
    public static function isMutable()
    {
        return true;
    }
}
```

This class extends PHP's native `DateTime` class and also uses a `Date` trait. Since `now()` method does not exist on `DateTime` class, it must be inside the `Date` trait.

```php
<?php

namespace Carbon\Traits;

use Carbon\Traits\Creator;

trait Date
{
	use Creator;
}
```

To my surprise, it was further inside a trait called `Creator` which is being used inside `Date` trait.

```php
<?php

namespace Carbon\Traits;

trait Creator
{
	/**
     * Create a new Carbon instance.
     *
     * Please see the testing aids section (specifically static::setTestNow())
     * for more on the possibility of this constructor returning a test instance.
     *
     * @param DateTimeInterface|string|null $time
     * @param DateTimeZone|string|null      $tz
     *
     * @throws InvalidFormatException
     */
    public function __construct($time = null, $tz = null)
    {
        try {
            parent::__construct(
                $time ?: 'now',
                static::safeCreateDateTimeZone($tz) ?: null
            );
        } catch (Exception $exception) {
            throw new InvalidFormatException(
                $exception->getMessage(), 0, $exception
            );
        }
    }

	/**
     * Get a Carbon instance for the current date and time.
     *
     * @param DateTimeZone|string|null $tz
     *
     * @return static
     */
    public static function now($tz = null)
    {
        return new static(null, $tz);
    }
}
```

Here we can finally see the `now()` method's definition. It is returning a new `Carbon\Carbon` instance using **static constructor** approach. I included the `__construct` method here to highlight the `parent::__construct` being called on PHP's native `DateTime` class. 

Therefore the About section of this package says **extension** of `DateTime` API.

## Interesting facts about `nesbot/carbon` package in Laravel

- This package was first added in Laravel **v4.0** on **19 Apr, 2013** by [Kapil Verma](https://github.com/kapv89)
- `v2` of carbon package was first supported in Laravel `v5.8` and then support for `v1` of the package was completely dropped in Laravel `v6.0`
- `Carbon\Carbon` class wrapped by `Illuminate\Support\Carbon` class in Laravel `v5.5` to make it **Macroable.** Pull Request can be found [here](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/19771).
