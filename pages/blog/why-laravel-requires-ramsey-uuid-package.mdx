From the About section on GitHub of ramsey/uuid package:

> A PHP library for generating universally unique identifiers (UUIDs).

First thing we notice that its not a Laravel package, instead a PHP library and it can be used in any PHP project. Secondly, **universally unique identifiers (UUIDs)**, let's talk a bit about what are UUIDs.

## What is a UUID?

UUID stands for **Universally Unique Identifier**. When it says Universally, it truly means Universally. 

> When you generate a UUID, its uniqueness can be guaranteed across space and time.

A UUID is 128 bits long and is usually represented as a hexadecimal string split into five groups with dashes, like below:

```php
998fd066-c786-4064-9c98-e378e450cd4a
```

We can use these **unique** values and assign them to our database records and later **identify** the records by these hexadecimal strings.

## UUIDs in Laravel

Laravel framework is famous for best Developer Experience (DX), therefore, Laravel makes it a cinch to work with UUIDs. If you open the **tinker** in Laravel project and write below code snippet:

```php
(string) Str::uuid();
```

You'll get an output like below:

```php
"220b94fc-04f9-48eb-a14a-ba868ff43919"
```

It's just that simple to create UUIDs  in Laravel. Now let's take a look at how it works and where `ramsey/uuid` package comes into play.

### Code Dive

If we dive into the definition of `Str::uuid()` method, we see the following:

```php
<?php

namespace Illuminate\Support;

use Ramsey\Uuid\Uuid;

class Str
{
	
    /**
     * The callback that should be used to generate UUIDs.
     *
     * @var callable
     */
    protected static $uuidFactory;
    

    /**
     * Generate a UUID (version 4).
     *
     * @return \Ramsey\Uuid\UuidInterface
     */
    public static function uuid()
    {
        return static::$uuidFactory
                    ? call_user_func(static::$uuidFactory)
                    : Uuid::uuid4();
    }

    /**
     * Set the callable that will be used to generate UUIDs.
     *
     * @param  callable|null  $factory
     * @return void
     */
    public static function createUuidsUsing(callable $factory = null)
    {
        static::$uuidFactory = $factory;
    }

}
```

If we first call `createUuidsUsing()` method and provide a `callback` that will create UUIDs, then `uuid()` method will execute that `callback` to generate a UUID. But if that's not the case, it will use `Uuid::uuid4()` from `ramsey/uuid` to generate the UUID for us. This is how Laravel is able to generate UUIDs by leveraging `ramsey/uuid` package.

You might be wondering about why this method is named as `uuid4()` ? What does `4` mean here?

There are five versions of UUIDs. Each version has different algorithm to generate it. Read more about all versions in [ramsey/uuid package docs](https://uuid.ramsey.dev/en/latest/rfc4122.html).

## UUIDs in Laravel migrations

Laravel provides a handy method on `Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint` class named `uuid` to specify in migrations that this column will be used to store a UUID.

```php
$table->uuid('id');
```

You might wonder if there's a **column type** in database which stores UUIDs, but that's not the case. If we look inside the `Illuminate\Database\Schema\Grammars\MySqlGrammar` class and find the `typeUuid()` method, we can see the following:

```php
    /**
     * Create the column definition for a uuid type.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Support\Fluent  $column
     * @return string
     */
    protected function typeUuid(Fluent $column)
    {
        return 'char(36)';
    }
```

Which means that `$table->uuid()` will be translated to a column wich `char` data type and its length would be `36` characters, always.

> Laravel does not generate UUIDs automatically for `uuid` columns. Developer must provide the logic to generate UUIDs when inserting records in the database.

## Interesting facts about `ramsey/uuid` in Laravel context

- This package was first required on **08 Aug, 2016** by **Taylor Otwell** when he worked on **channel specific notifications.** UUIDs were used to identify the database notifications.
