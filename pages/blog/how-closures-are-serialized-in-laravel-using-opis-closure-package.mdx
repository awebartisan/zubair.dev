From the About section of [opis/closure](https://github.com/opis/closure) package on GitHub:

> Serialize closures (anonymous functions)

Its pretty clear that it helps us serialize closures ( anonymous functions ) in PHP. Because PHP natively does not support serializing closures. It throws following error when you try to serialize a closure:

> Exception with message 'Serialization of 'Closure' is not allowed'

Let's see how and where Laravel framework uses this package and where it needs to serialize and closures.

## Code Dive

If we first look at the package [itself](https://github.com/opis/closure/tree/master/src), we can see that there are bunch of classes. `SerializableClosure.php` looks like the main class of this package. Also, there's no **ServiceProvider** for this package which means its not a Laravel package but a PHP package in general.

```php
<?php

namespace Opis\Closure;

use Closure;
use Serializable;
use SplObjectStorage;
use ReflectionObject;

class SerializableClosure implements Serializable
{
    /**
     * Implementation of Serializable::serialize()
     *
     * @return  string  The serialized closure
     */
    public function serialize()
    {
    }

    /**
     * Implementation of Serializable::unserialize()
     *
     * @param   string $data Serialized data
     * @throws SecurityException
     */
    public function unserialize($data)
    {
    }
}
```

We can see that this class implements PHP's `Serializable` interface, therefore, it must provide `serialize` and `unserialize` methods. I have ripped off implementations of these methods as its out of scope this blog post to see how serialization is done.

### Usage in Laravel

One of the major use of this package is **Queueing Closures** in Laravel. Read more about in [docs](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/queues#queueing-closures).

Example of dispatching a closure in Laravel:

```php
$post = App\Post::find(1);

dispatch(function () use ($post) {
    $post->publish();
});
```

To make this very feature possible, Laravel uses `opis/closure` package. Let's find out how.

### dispatch() helper

```php
    /**
     * Dispatch a job to its appropriate handler.
     *
     * @param  mixed  $job
     * @return \Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\PendingDispatch
     */
    function dispatch($job)
    {
        return $job instanceof Closure
                ? new PendingClosureDispatch(CallQueuedClosure::create($job))
                : new PendingDispatch($job);
    }
```

Inside dispatch helper, it checks if `$job` is instance of `Closure` class (provided by PHP). Other option here would be an instance of a job class that we create normally and they are serialized easily. We are interested in `Closure` so lets dig further into that.

### CallQueuedClosure::create()

```php
<?php

namespace Illuminate\Queue;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializableClosure;
use Illuminate\Bus\Batchable;
use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Container\Container;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\Dispatchable;
use ReflectionFunction;

class CallQueuedClosure implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Batchable, Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;

    /**
     * Create a new job instance.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Queue\SerializableClosure  $closure
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct(SerializableClosure $closure)
    {
        $this->closure = $closure;
    }

    /**
     * Create a new job instance.
     *
     * @param  \Closure  $job
     * @return self
     */
    public static function create(Closure $job)
    {
        return new self(new SerializableClosure($job));
    }
}
```

 `create()` method is a static constructor for `CallQueuedClosure` job class. Our closure which publishes the post is passed to `SerializableClosure` class constructor and a new instance is returned. Which is then assigned to `$this->closure` property on `CallQueuedClosure` job class. **At this point, our closure method is already serializable**.

 `Illuminate\Queue\SerializableClosure` class extends the `SerializableClsoure` class from `opis/closure` package.

```php
<?php

namespace Illuminate\Queue;

use Opis\Closure\SerializableClosure as OpisSerializableClosure;

class SerializableClosure extends OpisSerializableClosure
{
    use SerializesAndRestoresModelIdentifiers;

    /**
     * Transform the use variables before serialization.
     *
     * @param  array  $data The Closure's use variables
     * @return array
     */
    protected function transformUseVariables($data)
    {
        foreach ($data as $key => $value) {
            $data[$key] = $this->getSerializedPropertyValue($value);
        }

        return $data;
    }

    /**
     * Resolve the use variables after unserialization.
     *
     * @param  array  $data The Closure's transformed use variables
     * @return array
     */
    protected function resolveUseVariables($data)
    {
        foreach ($data as $key => $value) {
            $data[$key] = $this->getRestoredPropertyValue($value);
        }

        return $data;
    }
}
```

Laravel tends to wrap base classes from third-party packages into its own implementation, mostly with same name. That makes it easy for developers to further extend the functionality if they want to.

So far, we have seen that `CallQueuedClosure` is a job class which needs a `SerializableClosure` type **closure.** After that,  `new PendingClosureDispatch()` takes care of dispatching the `CallQueuedClosure` job. 

### PendingClosureDispatch

```php
<?php

namespace Illuminate\Foundation\Bus;

use Closure;

class PendingClosureDispatch extends PendingDispatch
{
    /**
     * Add a callback to be executed if the job fails.
     *
     * @param  \Closure  $callback
     * @return $this
     */
    public function catch(Closure $callback)
    {
        $this->job->onFailure($callback);

        return $this;
    }
}
```

We can see that this class is extending `PendingDispatch` which is responsible for dispatching normal job classes to the queues. 

- Here's a [link](https://divinglaravel.com/preparing-jobs-for-queue) from [Mohamed Said](https://twitter.com/themsaid)'s blog f you want to read more on how jobs are dispatched and when serialization occurs.

## Conclusion

To execute a task on a given **queue**, Laravel needs to serialize and un-serialize information on that task. It was okay for job classes as they can be serialized normally. But, in order to push `closure` based tasks to queue, Laravel team used `opis/closure` package to serialize and unserialize information on the closures ( anonymous functions ). 

## Interesting facts about `opis/closure` in Laravel context

- Queueing Closures feature was first offered in Laravel **v4.0**
- [Link](https://github.com/laravel/framework/commit/38ca53d9703e93ad8040b6379cc7e86efc8d7b15#diff-d2ab9925cad7eac58e0ff4cc0d251a937ecf49e4b6bf57f8b95aab76648a9d34) to very first commit on this feature by **Taylor Otwell** on **19 Apr, 2013** without using any third-party packages.
- `jeremeamia/SuperClosure` package was then used to perform serialization closures. It is now deprecated.
- [Link](https://github.com/laravel/framework/commit/eec168dc442cd1ee4e3c19bc3c289939f82b331e#diff-d2ab9925cad7eac58e0ff4cc0d251a937ecf49e4b6bf57f8b95aab76648a9d34) to commit where Taylor Otwell required the above mentioned package.
- From Laravel **v5.1** to **v5.6**, this feature was discontinued ( I was unable more information on this in docs and on GitHub repository )
- In Laravel **v5.7**, this feature was introduced again. [Link to PR](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/25777) by Taylor Otwell. It can be seen that `opis/closure` package was used this time.
