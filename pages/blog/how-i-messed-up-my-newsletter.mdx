Out of nowhere I decided to create a newsletter for my blog. I thought I would share my blogposts in newsletters, some people might find it easier to read my blog in their email inbox.

## What went wrong?

Many things. Mostly on my behalf. I didn‚Äôt do proper research and just jumped right into it.
I had an interaction with **Substack** few days ago and I had seen that it offers functionality to send newsletters. I just signed up and created my publication and shared all over the social media. And to my surprise, I got 20 subscribers within 1-2 hours.

I thought lets send a **Hello World** newsletter to my subscribers. And then I had moment of realisations about Substack.

-   Substack is a complete writing solution for Writers. Which means, it gives you a website and a newsletter.
-   You can only send content via newsletter which you also **post** on Substack.
-   I thought, okay, maybe I can set **canonical urls** of my own blog. Turns out, Substack doesn‚Äôt offer that
-   In that weak moment, I thought, okay, lets move my blog to Substack with custom domain. Guess what, custom domain is a paid feature which costs **50$** ( one-time fee )

Then I realised I should finally do some research üòÖ and also define my requirements.

## Options for sending newsletters other than Substack

-   Mailchimp
-   Mailcoach ( self-hosted )
-   Buttondown
-   ConvertKit
-   Drip
-   Gumroad
-   and more‚Ä¶

I also discussed this with [Tom Witkowski](https://twitter.com/devgummibeer) and he said ‚ÄúConvertKit is the default choice of Laravel Community ^^‚Äù .

## What I needed

A platform which:

-   Lets me own my content
-   Helps my audience to subscribe/unsubscribe easily
-   is GDPR compliant
-   A form widget to put on my blog
-   Supports markdown in the editor
-   Allows me to use my custom domain without any additional cost

ConvertKit was fulfilling all of these requirements. ( If you are reading this in your inbox, it came via ConvertKit )

> Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with ConvertKit and I am not trying to promote in this post. Also, not trying to defame Substack.

## What changes I needed to make it work with ConvertKit

First of all, I had to export my precious subscribers from Substack to ConvertKit. It was easy via CSV file.

After that I had to setup my email address. ConvertKit suggests not to use **free** email addresses like **@gmail.com** as it affects deliverability. Instead use an email address of your own domain, e.g. `info@zubairmohsin.dev`

Now there are many options available for email hosting too:

-   Google Workspace
-   Outlook
-   Zoho
-   Your own DNS provider might have it

I chose Zoho because it felt cheap at **$1.25 / user / month** and charged annually ( **$15** ).

### Time to setup Zoho

It‚Äôs a five step process.

-   Domain verification via TXT record
-   MX records setup
-   SPF records setup
-   DKIM records setup
-   DMARC records setup

I setup these records on my primary domain `zubairmohsin.dev` and I was happy to move on and send the newsletter. But then I recalled Tom Witkowki‚Äôs words to use a **subdomain** for newsletter. And I also read it somewhere ( possibly ConvertKit docs ) that its recommended to use **subdomain** for newsletter and newsletter‚Äôs email address.

Great, now I had to above 5 steps all-over again for a subdomain. But most importantly, where do I point this subdomain?

ConvertKit to the rescue again! They offer **landing pages** with many ready-to-go templates available. Also, you can use custom domains on these landing pages. That solved my subdomain problem and [letter.zubairmohsin.dev](https://letter.zubairmohsin.dev) was born.

## Conclusion

It‚Äôs okay to make mistakes, but I would also say that take some time do even a little of bit research. It pays off by saving you time and not getting frustrated by unexpected things. I hope you enjoy this post ( and future ones too).

Massive thanks to my subscribers üôèüèº
