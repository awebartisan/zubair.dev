We can leverage a `FormRequest` without actually submitting a form in two ways:

- Using the `after` hook on `Validator` instance
- Merging some data manually in the request and then validating it

Let's take a look at these.

## After hook on Validator instance

```jsx
class DestroyPostRequest extends FormRequest
{

    public function rules(): array
    {
        return [];
    }

    public function withValidator(Validator $validator): void
    {
        $validator->after(function ($validator) {
            if ($this->somethingElseIsInvalid()) {
                $validator->errors()->add('field', 'Something is wrong with this field!');
            }
        });
    }
}
```

In this case, `rules` method return an empty `array` since we don't have any fields against which we can perform validations.

By using the `withValidator` method, we are able to perform additional logic and add errors to the validator.

## Merge data manually in request and then validate it

```jsx
class DestroyPostRequest extends FormRequest
{

    public function prepareForValidation(): void
    {
        $this->merge([
            'post_id' => $this->route('id') 
        ]);
    }

    public function rules(): array
    {
        return [
            'post_id' => ['required', 'between:1,50']
        ];
    }
}
```

`prepareForValidation` allows us to intialize or sanitize the request data before validation rules are applied. We can also add some new data to request inside this method.

In above example, `post_id` field is being added to the request and then afterwards being validated inside the rules.
