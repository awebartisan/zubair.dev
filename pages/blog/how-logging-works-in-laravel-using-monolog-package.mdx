From the GitHub About section of [monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) package:

-   Sends your logs to files, sockets, inboxes, databases and various web services.

Take a look at [Handlers](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/tree/main/src/Monolog/Handler) directory of this package to see how many services it supports out of the box ðŸ¤¯

## Code Dive

In this blogpost, we'll start from the example so that we can get a taste of **diving,** instead of directly jumping to ServiceProvider. Let's start with an example usage of logging in Laravel.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

Log::info('hello world', ['data' => 'hello world again']);
```

First of all, let's jump to `Log` facade where we can see its returning a string `log`.

-   I am assuming reader knows how Facade works in Laravel.

### Log facade

```php
class Log extends Facade
{
    /**
     * Get the registered name of the component.
     *
     * @return string
     */
    protected static function getFacadeAccessor()
    {
        return 'log';
    }
}
```

We know that this string `log` has been **bound** already to a concrete implementation inside service container using a dedicated ServiceProvider. By following the convention we can safely assume that it must be `LogServiceProvider`.

Let's take another approach this time and ask the **container** to tell us the concrete class behind `log` string.

How do we do it? Pretty easy, using the `app()` helper.

```php
app('log');
```

If we `dd()` the result, we get:

```php
Illuminate\Log\LogManager {#178 â–¼
#app: Illuminate\Foundation\Application {#1 â–¶}
#channels: array:2 [â–¶]
#customCreators: array:1 [â–¶]
#dateFormat: "Y-m-d H:i:s"
#levels: array:8 [â–¶] }
```

There we have it, class behind `log` string. To verify that we got the correct class, let's take a look at `LogServiceProvider` too.

```php
<?php

namespace Illuminate\Log;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class LogServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register the service provider.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function register()
    {
        $this->app->singleton('log', function ($app) {
            return new LogManager($app);
        });
    }
}
```

### Log::info()

Now that we know `Log` facade uses `LogManager` class under-the-hood, we can safely assume that `info()` must exist on this class.

```php
/**
 * Interesting events.
 *
 * Example: User logs in, SQL logs.
 *
 * @param  string  $message
 * @param  array  $context
 *
 * @return void
 */
public function info($message, array $context = [])
{
    $this->driver()->info($message, $context);
}
```

`info()` method gets the `driver()` and calls `info()` method on that driver. Let's dig into `driver()` method and all its related methods.

```php
		/**
     * Get a log driver instance.
     *
     * @param  string|null  $driver
     * @return \Psr\Log\LoggerInterface
     */
    public function driver($driver = null)
    {
        return $this->get($driver ?? $this->getDefaultDriver());
    }

		/**
     * Get the default log driver name.
     *
     * @return string
     */
    public function getDefaultDriver()
    {
        return $this->app['config']['logging.default'];
    }

		/**
     * Attempt to get the log from the local cache.
     *
     * @param  string  $name
     * @return \Psr\Log\LoggerInterface
     */
    protected function get($name)
    {
        try {
            return $this->channels[$name] ?? with(
                $this->resolve($name),
                function ($logger) use ($name) {
                    return $this->channels[$name] = $this->tap(
                        $name,
                        new Logger($logger, $this->app['events'])
                    );
                }
            );
        } catch (Throwable $e) {
            return tap(
                $this->createEmergencyLogger(),
                function ($logger) use ($e) {
                    $logger->emergency(
                        'Using emergency logger.',
                        ['exception' => $e,]
                    );
                }
            );
        }
    }
```

The `driver()` method is getting the `default` driver from `config/logging.php` file. Laravel supports multi-channel logging, and each **channel** has its own **driver.** For the sake of simplicity, we'll consider `single` as our default channel with below config:

```php
'single' => [
            'driver' => 'single',
            'path' => storage_path('logs/laravel.log'),
            'level' => env('LOG_LEVEL', 'debug'),
        ],
```

Inside the `get()` method above, it's resolving the given **channel driver** by name and **applying taps** on it. (Read more about [taps](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/logging#customizing-monolog-for-channels) in the docs). If it can't resolve the channel driver, it creates an **emergency logger** which writes to `laravel.log` file. How can this happen? If you misspelled your channel name or driver name.

### resolve() method

```php
/**
 * Resolve the given log instance by name.
 *
 * @param  string  $name
 * @return \Psr\Log\LoggerInterface
 *
 * @throws \InvalidArgumentException
 */
protected function resolve($name)
{
    $config = $this->configurationFor($name);

    if (is_null($config)) {
        throw new InvalidArgumentException("Log [{$name}] is not defined.");
    }

    $driverMethod = 'create' . ucfirst($config['driver']) . 'Driver';

    if (method_exists($this, $driverMethod)) {
        return $this->{$driverMethod}($config);
    }

    throw new InvalidArgumentException(
        "Driver [{$config['driver']}] is not supported."
    );
}
```

It's getting the configuration for given driver and then creating a **method name** dynamically. In our case `$name = 'single'` so the `$driverMethod = 'createSingleDriver'` . After that, its calling that method with its configuration.

```php
use Monolog\Logger as Monolog;
use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;

/**
 * Create an instance of the single file log driver.
 *
 * @param  array  $config
 * @return \Psr\Log\LoggerInterface
 */
protected function createSingleDriver(array $config)
{
    return new Monolog($this->parseChannel($config), [
        $this->prepareHandler(
            new StreamHandler(
                $config['path'],
                $this->level($config),
                $config['bubble'] ?? true,
                $config['permission'] ?? null,
                $config['locking'] ?? false
            ),
            $config
        ),
    ]);
}
```

Here we can see that a new instance of `Monolog\Logger` is returned with **channel name** and a **handler** which also provided by **monolog** package.

For the sake of understanding, in the end `input()` method is called on `Monolog\Logger` class.

```php
/**
 * Adds a log record at the INFO level.
 *
 * This method allows for compatibility with common interfaces.
 *
 * @param string  $message The log message
 * @param mixed[] $context The log context
 */
public function info($message, array $context = []): void
{
    $this->addRecord(static::INFO, (string) $message, $context);
}
```

`addRecord` method is responsible for writing log record in the file. How it writes to the file is out of scope of this blogpost.

## Interesting facts about Monolog in Laravel context

-   This package has been part of Laravel since the beginning ( maybe ).
-   [Link](https://github.com/laravel/framework/commit/de69bb287c5017d1acb7d47a6db1dedf578036d6#diff-d2ab9925cad7eac58e0ff4cc0d251a937ecf49e4b6bf57f8b95aab76648a9d34) to very first commit of `laravel/framework` on GitHub made by **Taylor Otwell** on
    **11 Jan, 2013** confirms the above statement.
-   On GitHub, we only have access to version `4.0` of `laravel/framework`, so, not sure if this package was part of Laravel in versions earlier than `4.0`.
